            <h2>Why Sponsor?</h2>
          </header>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Want to to reach out to the technology community? Developers, graphic designers, scientists, mathematicians, creatives and even non-techies? They all love to attend BarCamps to increase their knowledge by sharing, networking, socialising and generally having a fantastic time. BarCamps reach out to a wide audience (getting wider each year) of people who are actively involve in and shape the technology communities.</p>
            <p>BarCamps are community conferences, run by volunteers. Nobody is charged for attending a BarCamp although everyone is expected to give a presentation or lead a discussion session. Due to the nature of the event there are a number of costs incurred which make great sponsorship opportunities for local businesses, regional tech/industry companies and international companies looking to increase their exposure amongst the Nottingham and regional technology creative and digital communities.</p>
            <p>Barcamps happen all over the world. The UK barcamps have a huge national following with many delegates travelling vast distances to attend (one of the many reasons barcamps are generally overnight events).</p>
