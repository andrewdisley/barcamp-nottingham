            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Barcamp is a free unconference with no scheduled speakers.</p>
          </header>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Attendees arrive on the day armed with talks and decide which ones they want to go along to! The talks can be on anything, from android application development to learning the British Sign Language to Electronic Organs played by BBC Micros! But don’t worry, you don’t have to do a talk to participate! The event is paid for by our <a href="{{ site.url }}sponsors/">lovely sponsors</a>. Thanks especially to <strong>(company name)</strong> for sponsoring the venue.</p>
